# Exo-Planet-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
A Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture to correctly Identify whether a given Signal is a transiting Exo-Planet or a false Positive.

## Directory Structure
 
The directory Contains the Following Files:-

1.**NoteBooks** :- This folder Contains Jupyter notebooks on various architectures used for Exo-Planet Detection using the Kepler Labelled Time-Series Dataset Provided in Inter IIT Tech Meet 2017. The dataset can be found at Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data/tasks).

2.**Report** :- A pdf file of Detailed Analysis on Approaches used and Architecures implemented for Exo-Planet Detection alongwith results. A brief Summary of the Report is given in the README file.

3.**Transit Photometry** :- This folder Contains references to explanation of Transit Photometry(The technique used for Detecting Exo-Planets.
